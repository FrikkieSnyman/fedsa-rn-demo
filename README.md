# React-Native: A beginner's adventure

Hi there!

In this repo, you'll find the code that I've presented during my talk for FEDSA.

The final product is located in the `demo` folder.

## Getting started

Clone the repo, and run `yarn install`. 

## Running the app

Run `yarn start`.

This will start the Metro bundler. You can then run the app on an emulator or simulator by hitting `a` (for android) or `i`  (for iOS).

Alternatively, you can also run `yarn android` or `yarn ios`.
